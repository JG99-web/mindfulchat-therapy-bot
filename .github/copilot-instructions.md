- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Maintain clean, readable JavaScript code
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Ensure secure handling of user data (even if anonymous)
- Use appropriate mental health language and terminology

## UI/UX Considerations
- Use calming, professional color schemes
- Provide clear navigation and user flow
- Include appropriate disclaimers about the nature of AI therapy
- Design for users who may be in distressed states
- Implement smooth, non-jarring transitions and animations
